    Creates a file uploader widget for CSV, Excel, and JSON data files.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    None
    
    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[Optional[pd.DataFrame], Optional[str]]
        A tuple containing:
        - DataFrame with the uploaded data (None if no upload)
        - Filename of the uploaded file (None if no upload)
    
    Notes
    -----
    Supported file formats:
    - CSV (.csv)
    - Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
    - JSON (.json)
    
    The component automatically detects the file type from the extension
    and uses the appropriate pandas reader function.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> df, filename = data_uploader()
    >>> if df is not None:
    ...     # Do something with the DataFrame
    ...     print(f"Loaded {filename} with {len(df)} rows")
