Mid-Year Performance Review Key Steps:

Our approach to performance management brings increased flexibility and a streamlined process for both leaders and colleagues. Outlined below are the high-level key steps in the Mid-Year Performance Review process.

1. Colleague Self-Evaluation

• Colleague can request feedback on themselves or provide their leader with a list of stakeholders who can offer meaningful feedback on their performance throughout the assessment period. All feedback provided throughout the assessment period that is selected to Share With Others will be displayed in the Mid-Year Review form for reference. 

• Colleague documents progress and results achieved against goals and demonstration of Heart At Work Behaviors™ when delivering on those goals and submits Self-Evaluation to leader. 

• Once colleague submits the Self-Evaluation form, the leader will immediately gain access to complete the Leader Evaluation task. 

2. Leader Evaluation

• Leader reviews colleague’s Self-Evaluation comments and feedback from stakeholders to integrate into their Mid-Year Review comments. 

• Leader documents and finalizes comments on colleague’s progress for achievement of goals and demonstration of Heart At Work Behaviors™ when delivering on those goals.

• Leader can send form back to Self-Evaluation, if necessary, during the Leader Evaluation step by opening the Leader Evaluation form and navigating to the Review and Submit tab to select ' Send Back.' Colleagues must then resubmit the form to return it to the Leader Evaluation step. 

• If leader is still making edits to the Leader Evaluation, select 'Save for Later' on the Review and Submit tab to maintain access. 

3. Mid-Year Performance and Feedback Discussion

• Leader and colleague meet 1:1 to discuss performance against achievement of goals, demonstration of Heart At Work Behaviors™ and expectations of collaboration and productivity going forward.

• Leader and colleague should reflect on accomplishments and discuss areas of opportunity for continued development and growth.

• Leader and colleague should discuss colleague's individual development goals tied to their personal career aspirations.

4. Submit Deliver Performance Discussion Task

• After leader and colleague hold performance and feedback discussion, leader submits the Deliver Performance Discussion task. This provides the colleague with the Mid-Year Review form details, including leader comments and ratings. Submission of this task serves as the leader's acknowledgement of the performance and feedback discussion. 

5. Colleague Acknowledgement

• Colleague acknowledges the Mid-Year performance and feedback discussion occurred and submits Acknowledgment task in Workday.

Development Discussion
A culture of growth and development:

At CVS Health, we believe colleagues should feel empowered to own and drive their career development. Leaders should be supportive by welcoming career conversations and recommending opportunities for their team members to learn and grow. Regular and ongoing development discussions help leaders and colleagues understand individual career aspirations, development needs and ways they can enhance their skills. While development conversations can take place at any time, Goal Setting, Mid-Year and Year-End Performance Reviews are excellent opportunities for colleagues and leaders to check in on development progress to date. 

A development plan is key:

An up-to-date development plan ensures self-accountability and success and can guide development conversations with leaders. Colleagues should reference their plan often to track progress and modify learning activities. It’s important to not only include formal learning (e.g., a training session), but also relationships (e.g., working with a mentor or coach) and experiences (e.g., stretch assignments or job shadowing).
 
To Do: 

•    Use the form below to document 2-3 development activities that align to your short-term career ambitions. Example: Improve project leadership skills.
•    Identify specific actions to support each development activity and list under “additional information.” Include a variety of learning types such as skills training, education, mentoring, work experiences, etc. Example: Complete Influencing Skills workshop; solicit feedback after leadership presentation; volunteer to lead XYZ project.
•    Outline start and end dates for completing each action.
•    Discuss your development plan with your leader and how they can support your goals.
•    Review your development plan regularly to update progress and dates as you complete development actions.
